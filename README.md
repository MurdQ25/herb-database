# Herb Database 🌿 | tryherbals.com

Welcome to the **Herb Database**, the future home of [tryherbals.com](https://tryherbals.com)—a free project to share medicinal herb knowledge with everyone, no logins needed! We’re starting with **500 herbs** and aim to grow to **30,000**, with details like uses, safety, and links to buy from trusted sellers. Hosted on GitHub and soon on tryherbals.com, this is a community effort to make herbs accessible.

## 📋 What Is This?

This project is a public database of herbs (like Echinacea, Ginger) with info on:
- **Common Name** (e.g., Chamomile)
- **Scientific Name** (e.g., *Matricaria chamomilla*)
- **Properties** (e.g., Calming, anti-inflammatory)
- **Uses** (e.g., Helps sleep, soothes stomach)
- **Precautions** (e.g., May cause allergies)
- **Habitat** (e.g., Europe, Asia)
- **Parts Used** (e.g., Flowers)
- **Preparation** (e.g., Tea, oil)
- **Citations** (e.g., Science studies, herbal books)
- **Vendor Links** (coming soon: where to buy herbs)

It’s:
- **Free**: No cost to use.
- **Private**: No accounts or tracking.
- **Open**: Anyone can add herbs or ideas.

## 📊 Where We’re At

- **Data**: `herbs_1-500.csv` has 500 herbs (~0.5 MB).
- **Goal**: 30,000 herbs (~4 GB with photos).
- **Tools**:
  - CSV file on GitHub.
  - Planned: Website on tryherbals.com showing herbs easily.
  - Maybe: A database (like SQLite) for searches.
- **Next**:
  - Show herbs on tryherbals.com.
  - Add links to buy herbs.
  - Let people add more herbs.

## 🚀 How to Use It

### For Everyone
- **See the Herbs**: Download `herbs_1-500.csv` from this repo to read the list in Excel or Google Sheets.

### For Coders
I’m looking for a **Pensacola coder** to join me for **equity** (20–50% share, we’ll talk). You’d:
- Turn the CSV into a database (e.g., SQLite).
- Build a simple website for tryherbals.com to show herbs and seller links.
- Set up hosting (~4 GB needed).

**What It Takes**:
- **Storage**: 4 GB for 30,000 herbs (60 MB text + 3.5 GB photos).
- **Setup**: Cheap server ($5–10/month) or free GitHub Pages.
- **Skills**: Python (pandas, Flask) or JavaScript; GitHub know-how.
- **Traffic**: 60 GB/month for text, more with photos (we can optimize).

Want in? Email contact@tryherbals.com with your GitHub or a quick idea for the project (e.g., “I’d add a search bar”). Live in Pensacola? Let’s meet at Bodacious Brew!
