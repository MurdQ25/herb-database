# Herb Database 🌿 | tryherbals.com

Welcome to the **Herb Database**, the heart of [tryherbals.com](https://tryherbals.com)—a free project to share medicinal herb knowledge with everyone, no logins needed! We’re starting with **500 herbs** and aiming for **30,000**, with details like uses, safety, and links to buy from herb sellers. Hosted on GitHub and soon live on tryherbals.com, this is a community effort to make herbs easy to learn about.

## 📋 What Is This?

This project is a public list of herbs (like Echinacea, Ginger) with info on:
- **Common Name** (e.g., Chamomile)
- **Scientific Name** (e.g., *Matricaria chamomilla*)
- **Properties** (e.g., Calming, anti-inflammatory)
- **Uses** (e.g., Helps sleep, soothes stomach)
- **Precautions** (e.g., May cause allergies)
- **Habitat** (e.g., Europe, Asia)
- **Parts Used** (e.g., Flowers)
- **Preparation** (e.g., Tea, oil)
- **Citations** (e.g., Science studies, herbal books)
- **Vendor Links** (coming soon: where to buy herbs)

It’s:
- **Free**: No cost to use.
- **Private**: No accounts or tracking.
- **Open**: Anyone can add herbs or ideas.

## 📊 Where We’re At

- **Data**: `herbs_1-500.csv` has 500 herbs (~0.5 MB). Other files (e.g., `herbs_51-100.csv`) are backups.
- **Goal**: Grow to 30,000 herbs (~4 GB with photos).
- **Tools**:
  - CSV files on GitHub.
  - Planned: Website on tryherbals.com to show herbs.
  - Maybe: A database (like SQLite) for searches.
- **Next**:
  - Make tryherbals.com show the herbs.
  - Add links to buy herbs.
  - Let people add more herbs.

## 🚀 How to Use It

### For Everyone
- **See the Herbs**: Download `herbs_1-500.csv` to open in Excel or Google Sheets.
- **Wait For**: tryherbals.com to show herbs easily (no coding needed).

### For Coders
I’m looking for a **Pensacola coder** to join for **equity** (20–50% share, we’ll talk). You’d:
- Turn the CSV into a database (e.g., SQLite).
- Build a simple tryherbals.com site to show herbs and seller links.
- Set up hosting (~4 GB needed).
- Work with me on GitHub.

**What It Takes**:
- **Storage**: 4 GB for 30,000 herbs (60 MB text + 3.5 GB photos).
- **Setup**: Cheap server ($5–10/month) or free GitHub Pages.
- **Skills**: Python (pandas, Flask) or JavaScript; GitHub basics.
- **Traffic**: 60 GB/month for text, more with photos (we can make it smaller).

Want in? Email contact@tryherbals.com with your GitHub or one idea (e.g., “I’d add a search bar”). In Pensacola? Coffee at Bodacious Brew?
