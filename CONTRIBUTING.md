# Contributing to Herb Database 🌿 | tryherbals.com

Thanks for helping the **Herb Database** at [tryherbals.com](https://tryherbals.com)! This free, no-login project shares herb knowledge (500 herbs now, 30,000 later) with links to buy herbs. Whether you love herbs or code, you can make tryherbals.com better.

## 📋 How Can I Help?

### Add Herbs
Our list is in `herbs_1-500.csv`. Want to add or fix an herb?
- **What Goes In**: Each herb needs:
  - Common Name (e.g., Ginger)
  - Scientific Name (e.g., *Zingiber officinale*)
  - Properties (e.g., Anti-inflammatory)
  - Uses (e.g., Eases nausea)
  - Precautions (e.g., Avoid with blood thinners)
  - Habitat (e.g., Southeast Asia)
  - Parts Used (e.g., Root)
  - Preparation (e.g., Tea)
  - Citations (e.g., WHO book)
  - Vendor Links (e.g., shop URLs; leave blank for now)
- **Steps**:
  1. Click “Fork” on this repo.
  2. Open `herbs_1-500.csv` in Excel, Google Sheets, or Notepad.
  3. Add a row or edit an herb. Keep it short (~50–100 letters).
  4. Check your info (use books or trusted websites).
  5. Save and “Commit” with a note (e.g., “Added Ginger”).
  6. Click “Pull Request” to send it to me.
- **Tips**:
  - Don’t add the same herb twice—check the CSV.
  - Add a source (e.g., “PubMed: 123456”).

### Code for tryherbals.com
Want to build the website?
- **Ideas**:
  - Turn the CSV into a database (like SQLite).
  - Make tryherbals.com show herbs.
  - Add a search (e.g., find “calming” herbs).
- **Steps**:
  1. Fork the repo.
  2. Add a file (e.g., `web.py` for a website).
  3. Try Python (pandas, Flask) or JavaScript.
  4. Test it (e.g., `python web.py`).
  5. Commit with a note (e.g., “Added herb page”).
  6. Send a pull request.
- **Needs**:
  - ~4 GB space for 30,000 herbs (with photos).
  - Cheap server ($5/month) or free GitHub Pages.
