# Contributing to Herb Database 🌿 | tryherbals.com

Thank you for helping build the **Herb Database** for [tryherbals.com](https://tryherbals.com)! This free, no-login project shares herb knowledge (500 herbs now, 30,000 someday) with vendor links to support sellers. Whether you know herbs or code, your contributions make tryherbals.com better for everyone.

I'm Kathy.

## 📋 How Can I Help?

### Add Herbs
Our data is in `herbs_1-500.csv`. Want to add or fix an herb?
- **What’s Needed**: Each herb has:
  - Common Name (e.g., Ginger)
  - Scientific Name (e.g., *Zingiber officinale*)
  - Properties (e.g., Anti-inflammatory)
  - Uses (e.g., Eases nausea)
  - Precautions (e.g., Avoid with blood thinners)
  - Habitat (e.g., Southeast Asia)
  - Parts Used (e.g., Root)
  - Preparation (e.g., Tea)
  - Citations (e.g., WHO Monographs)
  - Vendor Links (e.g., herb shop URLs; optional)
- **Steps**:
  1. Click “Fork” on this repo’s page.
  2. Open `herbs_1-500.csv` in Excel or Google Sheets.
  3. Add a new row or edit an herb. Keep entries short (~50–100 characters, links ~200).
  4. Check facts with books, studies, or trusted sites.
  5. Save and “Commit” with a note (e.g., “Added Ginger”).
  6. Click “Pull Request” to send it to me.
- **Tips**:
  - Don’t repeat herbs—search the CSV first.
  - Cite a source (e.g., “PubMed: 123456” or “Ayurveda book”).

### Code for tryherbals.com
Want to build the website or database?
- **Ideas**:
  - Make the CSV a database (like SQLite).
  - Create a tryherbals.com page to show herbs.
  - Add search (e.g., find “calming” herbs).
- **Steps**:
  1. Fork the repo.
  2. Make a new file or folder (e.g., `web/` for site code).
  3. Use Python (pandas, Flask) or JavaScript.
  4. Test it (e.g., run `python mycode.py`).
  5. Commit with a note (e.g., “Added herb search”).
  6. Send a pull request.
- **Needs**:
  - ~4 GB storage for 30,000 herbs (with photos).
  - Cheap server ($5–10/month) or free GitHub Pages.
